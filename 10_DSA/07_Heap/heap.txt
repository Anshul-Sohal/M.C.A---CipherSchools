Heap is a tree data structure where the tree must be a Complete Binary Tree and contain some Heap order Property
1. Max Heap
2. Min Heap

Max Heap :- The root has the highest value from the child.
Min Heap :- The root has the Lowest value from the child.

In order to find Left and Right Child we can Find them using:-

for 1 based indexing -
    Left Child = 2*i.
    Right Child = 2*i + 1.

for 0 based indexing - 
    Left Child = 2*i + 1;
    Right Child = 2*i + 2;

For finding the Parent of any Child  = i/2.

For Insertion in a heap :-
    we insert at end.
    check wether its still holds the heap order Property.

For Deletion in a heap :-
    replace last with root.
    Remove last.
    place root at its correct position.

In heap n/2 + 1 to n are leaf nodes (n being the size of the heap);
